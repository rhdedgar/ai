//! Anthropic Messages operation registry.
//!
//! Operation identity comes from the request head — method, path, and transport
//! — rather than from body heuristics, so a request is recognized before any
//! payload is read. A Chat Completions-shaped, malformed, empty, or absent body
//! cannot change which operation the same head resolves to.
//!
//! # Source of truth
//!
//! The inventory below is transcribed from the pinned `OpenAPI` document vendored
//! at `docs/conformance/specs/anthropic-spec.json`, whose upstream origin and
//! digests are recorded in `docs/conformance/specs/anthropic-spec-source.json`.
//! Methods, paths, operation IDs, and request-body shapes are reproduced
//! verbatim from that document, including upstream's `snake_case` operation IDs.
//!
//! Scope is the non-beta `/v1/messages` surface, matching the scope
//! `docs/conformance/README.md` already declares for Anthropic review. The
//! other Anthropic surfaces (`/v1/complete`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/files`, and the
//! platform APIs) are deliberately absent: Praxis does not handle them, so they
//! publish no operation match.
//!
//! # Beta variants are a header concern, not a path
//!
//! The pinned document lists each beta variant under a path key suffixed
//! `?beta=true` — for example `GET /v1/messages/batches?beta=true` with
//! operation ID `beta_message_batches_list`. That suffix is a key the
//! mock-server document uses to keep both variants distinct within one
//! `OpenAPI` file; it is not a request parameter. Neither variant declares a
//! `beta` query parameter: they differ by the `anthropic-beta` request header.
//!
//! So no real request path carries `?beta=true`, and registering such entries
//! would both encode that artifact and still miss real beta traffic, which
//! arrives on the non-beta path with a header. The beta operation IDs are
//! therefore not registered, and beta selection is not part of operation
//! identity — the same treatment `anthropic-version` already gets.
//!
//! One consequence is worth stating plainly: because query strings do not
//! affect matching, a request to `/v1/messages/batches?beta=true` resolves to
//! `message_batches_list`, the non-beta operation its method and path name.
//! Distinguishing beta behavior is left to Anthropic request processing and the
//! backend, which can read the header.
//!
//! `cargo xtask check-anthropic-messages-registry` compares this registry's
//! methods, paths, and operation IDs against the pinned document at CI time.
//! There is no `oasdiff` structural comparison or capability projection for
//! Anthropic.
//!
//! # Handling modes
//!
//! [`HandlingMode`] describes what Praxis does at its boundary, not which chain
//! a deployment assembles. `createMessage` is [`HandlingMode::Inspect`] because
//! every supported chain reads selected fields from it while preserving the
//! forwarded payload; whether a chain additionally rewrites it for a Chat
//! Completions backend is pipeline configuration rather than operation
//! identity. The batch and token-counting operations are
//! [`HandlingMode::Passthrough`]: no Anthropic filter deliberately targets
//! them.
